    typeorm has the following features:
    - Entity: a class that represents a table in the database
    - Column: a property of an entity that maps to a column in the database
    - PrimaryGeneratedColumn: a special column that is automatically generated when a new entity is created
    - BaseEntity: a class that is extended by all other entities
    - OneToMany: a relationship between two entities that is one-to-many
    - ManyToOne: a relationship between two entities that is many-to-one
    - ManyToMany: a relationship between two entities that is many-to-many
    - JoinColumn: a column that is used to join two entities together   ยง
    - JoinTable: a table that is used to join two entities together
    - OneToOne: a relationship between two entities that is one-to-one
